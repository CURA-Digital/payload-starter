# Payload Starter

Unofficial Payload CMS starter template based on the Payload Website Template.

Main differences:

1) Added support for nested nav menus.
2) Reorganized Posts and Pages collections to be more similar to WordPress users.
3) Removed dark mode support.
4) Added automatic scaling of new images to 2560px max width.

Also started adding Magic UI components as blocks with the first being the box reveal available.

To get started, you need to configure your Postgres connection string and payload secret in your env.
